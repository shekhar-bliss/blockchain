Miners validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger ( blockchain ).

Bitcoin mining
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitcoin mining is legal and is accomplished by running SHA256 double round hash
verification processes in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and provide the
requisite security for the public ledger of the Bitcoin network.


The speed at which you mine Bitcoins is measured in hashes per second.


The Bitcoin network compensates Bitcoin miners for their effort by releasing
bitcoin to those who contribute the needed computational power. This comes in
the form of both newly issued bitcoins and from the transaction fees included in
the transactions validated when mining bitcoins. The more computing power you
contribute then the greater your share of the reward.
